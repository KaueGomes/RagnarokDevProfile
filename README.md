# RagnarokDevProfile

This is my resume based in Ragnarok Online, one of my favorite games since 2004 when I played for the first time.

I'm working only with html, css and javascript as a challenge for myself, it was running until march 2024 but now I'm working in a few changes

Expectations
- Responsive HTML so any device can access 📱
- Adding a few functionallities as plugins ➕
- Trying to apply good practices on my code so can be organized 📁

Tips, advices, suggestions, text me 😁
